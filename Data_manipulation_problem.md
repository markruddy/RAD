# Data manipulation problem #

Running RStudio 0.97.248

The dataset RYA13Report_transect_AB.csv is in a sort of 'longform' at the moment. Which I would like to change so that:

1. Each Pack_Name is a column
2. Each BH_Name is a row
3. Top-mOD are variables of Pack_Name

I've played around with reshape but can't fathom it out. 

Any help appreciated.
